I am a graduate student at Duke University currently studying for a Master's degree in Data Science. :woman_student:

I am a data enthusiast, and I can make data tell stories! Since my childhood, I have been somewhat of an investigator :female_detective: (thanks to all the Sherlock Holmes stories), and being a Data Scientist allows me to be one. Working with data adds a certain sense of empowerment as I can innovate and identify trends, patterns, and outliers. This field of work also allows collaborating with individuals with diverse backgrounds. Everyone has something interesting to bring to the table! 

My skills include:

- **Programming:** Python (pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn), R, SQL
- **Machine Learning:** Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, SVM, NaÃ¯ve Bayes, KNN, K-Means, Random Forest, PCA, Gradient Boosting Algorithms
- **Deep Learning:** Neural Network, Convolutional Neural Network (TensorFlow2, Keras), Natural Language Processing (NLTK)
- **Data Visualization Tools:** Matplotlib, Seaborn, PowerBI, Tableau
- **Cloud:** AWS Sagemaker, AWS S3
- **Web Development Tools:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **MS Office Tools:** Excel, Word, PowerPoint
